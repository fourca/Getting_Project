Hello ! 
In this repo, you will find: 
- an R Script to analyse data from a movement analysis study performed Samsung on its new phone.
- a CodeBook to help understand a bit more. 
- in the script, I assumed that you downloaded the data from the company (see CodeBook) on your computer and know use to use the getwd() and setwd() commands for R. 

Have fun !
